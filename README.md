Hi, I'm Corissa. I am a data QA Engineer with a varied background in software testing, web development, writing, and marketing. I love words, people, and pursuing the meaning of high quality in software development and data engineering. When I'm not programming for work or fun, I'm usually reading, playing video games, or hanging out with my dogs.
