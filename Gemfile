# Hello! This is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run.
# When you want to use a different version, change it below, save the
# file and run `bundle install`. Run Jekyll with `bundle exec`, like so:
#
#     bundle exec jekyll serve
#
# This will help ensure the proper Jekyll version is running.

# This is the default theme for new Jekyll sites. You may change this to anything you like.
gem 'corissawex-hitchens-theme', '~> 0.1.0'

# To update plugin gems, run `bundle update github-pages`. If you have any plugins, put them here!
