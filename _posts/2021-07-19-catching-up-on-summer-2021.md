title: Catching Up on Summer 2021
---

I am happy to say that with the waning of COVID-19 cases in Maine, USA where I live, the easing of safety restrictions and my new fully vaccinated status, I have been so busy I have forgotten to share a little bit about what's going on in my life this summer. Here are a few highlights of some of the great things that have been going on.

### Roller Skate Life
Some time in May, I can't remember the exact day at this point, I broke out my roller skates, which had not been used in far too long, and started practicing again at home. A week or so later I made it to the skate rink where I practiced more, and then slowly but surely began to pursue the kind of skating I've always wanted to be able to do. About three months later, I'm still not the skater I want to be, not even a little bit, but I'm getting there. I'm proud of the muscle growth and aches and bruises and pains that come with growing into athleticism after being inside most of the year. I'm sweating like I never have before with awesome friends, and loving it. 
### Learning About My Maine Family
I recently learned that although I have lived in Maine for almost 11 years now, I didn't realize how much of my great-grandmother's family lived in Maine and were buried here. It was interesting and eye-opening to visit family graves that are less than two hours from my home. Somehow all this time my ancestors have been resting in places I've passed by, know, and love, but I never knew their bodies were there beside the Androscoggin. There is something about that, that makes me feel even more connected to Maine. I can't wait to investigate and find out more about my Maine ancestors. 
### Becoming a Stronger Technical Writer
This is a huge one for me! I'm so excited to say that I've been writing more and more technical documentation, guides, and blog posts for work, freelance, and just for informational purposes on [my Dev.to blog](http://dev.to/corissa). I've pushed through imposter syndrome, creative doubt, personal family problems while trying to meet writing deadlines, and questioning my own expertise. One of my favorite things about the technical writing I do for [Draft.dev](https://draft.dev/) is learning that I know a lot more than I think I do. My five years in software QA comes in handy alongside all of the data testing work I've been doing for about a year now. I love writing, and I love the encouragement I get from my editors and writing clients. The energy in the data science community is fresh and positive, and I truly feel that! It's wonderful to get to share it in writing. 

#### See Ya Soon!
So yes, it's been a pretty great summer so far. Most of my rejuvenation / vacation time is coming up in August, so I am sure I will have all kinds of sketches and stories from camping out in the woods and going on adventures in New England to share with you. For now, get outside and enjoy the sun if you can!
