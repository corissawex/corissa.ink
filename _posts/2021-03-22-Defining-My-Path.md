title: Defining My Learning Path
'categories:': School

It should come as no surprise to anyone who's known me for a little bit that I love to learn. It's one of the greatest strengths I gained from being a homeschooled kid. The ability to enjoy learning something new isn't easy, and frankly not every lesson is a fun one. But in general when it comes to taking classes and engaging in conversation about what we're learning, I love to be involved. 

When I first went off to college out of high school, I found a difficult and different social world than the one I'd grown up in. Being a sheltered kid who never attended public or private school put me on the outside of most American kids' experience. I grew up a lot in the three years that I spent at a four year state college, but most of that was social and emotional. The academic focus was diminished in light of all the exciting friend drama I found myself getting into as a college kid, and the fact that I was working three jobs to afford college. You can see why I wasn't feeling the cost of my education at the time.

Fast forward a decade later, and I have an opportunity to attend school through a family member's work benefits. I was so excited to learn about it last fall and immediately signed up for a Business Management degree with a focus in Data Science. It not only makes total sense for me, I have been loving the extra work during these stay-at-home times we live in. 

I understand more clearly these days that I will get from my college classes what I put into them. It's up to me in a lot of ways to learn something new, especially given that I've been working in the business and data worlds for nearly my entire career. And yet it doesn't seem hard to look into my texts, projects, and assignments to find something new I'd not thought of before.

There is a special power for me in designing my own way of learning, and trying to live in that love for it. If I look back on my college days, even then I was learning plenty! It just happened to be about human beings and the real world outside of the one I grew up in. I often used to think of my dropping out of school as a failure, but it was in fact the perfect path and just another learning point in my life. I had no idea it would bring me to where I am today, but I am happy I have found my way.
